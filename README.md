# EOOLS
eve online on life support

A multiplayer 2d stragety oriented space ship smack down inspired by eve online that runs entirely on the terminal. <i>why?</i> because graphics are just a excuse! 
<br>EOOLS, named as such since that was the intended result.
<br>Inspired by Eve Online.

todo
 - indepth controls for server administration
 - physics & "realism"(for what ever counts in a scifi setting)
